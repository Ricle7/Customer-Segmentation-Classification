This project is related to an automobile company planning to enter new markets with existing products (P1, P2, P3, P4, and P5). After intensive market research, they've deduced that the behavior of the new market is similar to their existing market. In their existing market, the sales team has classified all customers into 4 segments (A, B, C, D). Then, they performed segmented outreach and communication for a different segment of customers. This strategy has worked exceptionally well for them. They plan to use the same strategy for the new markets and have identified 2627 new potential customers. Your task is to help the manager predict the right group for the new customers.
